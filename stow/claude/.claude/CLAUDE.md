# Developer Context

## Background
- Primary language: Go
- Can read most common programming languages
- Values clean, well-tested code
- Prefers minimal dependencies

## Code Philosophy
- Clean code over clever code
- Conventional approaches before clever solutions
- Comprehensive testing is essential
- Minimize external dependencies

## Shell/Script Preferences
- Use safer command versions by default
- Example: `rm` or `rm -r` before `rm -rf`
- When unsafe commands are necessary, include comments explaining why
- Prioritize safety and clarity in automation

## Testing Standards
- Code should be well-tested
- Tests should be clear and maintainable
- Prefer table-driven tests in Go
